                Growing up in Rhode Island, he passed the time by memorizing 
                every lyric to Lady Gaga's Born This Way and Kylie Minogue’s 
                Fever. He can spend hours talking about pop culture (especially 
                with Kiara) and decided to make a show about it. While his 
                knowledge of pop music comes solely from Wikipedia and Reddit, he 
                tries his best carry a good conversation about the topic at hand. 
                If you see him on the street, a simple smile and a wave will make 
                his day! He worked very hard on this website and hopes everyone 
                enjoys their time on this page. One thing that the average person 
                does not know about this fellow is favorite movie is Moulin 
                Rouge!</p>

            <p><b>Kiara Smith</b> is from the humble hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas and 
                yes, she is aware that she is the first person you have ever met from 
                Arkansas. She is a junior Arts and Entertainment Management Major 
                and she loves all thing Pop Culture, but specifically all things Blue 
                Ivy, Beyonce, and the twins Rumi and Sir. Her career goal is to 
                become a creative director for concert tours and to be rich enough to 
                get a fruit tart from whenever she wants. All in all she is a 
                simple girl that likes good music and good people. 
                If you see her in the street she is probably listening to Up Out My 
                Face by Mariah Carey. However, if you can't find her then she is
                probably in her room listening to HAIM’s Something to Tell You album 
                for the millionth time.</p>
